A set of different movements / shaders to choose from for each villager to have a few:
Constant:
	* An idle animation: float, wiggle, stretch/squash breathe, lean-shear back and forth
	(also determines their seperate 'movement' animation?)
Periodic:
	* A idle animation:
	* A shine / sparkle showing their rarity
On gover:
	
Ideas for villagers (or triggers or effects or w/e):
	* When any other villager sleeps
	* Frail resident - dies if player tries to resettle
	* anytime anyone visits anyone
	* anytime anyone moves
	* anytime anyone meets another
	
	* In the caravan shop, you can dismiss vilalgers by two methods:
		one sells for crystal-tears, one sells for crystal-laughs,
		just dependent on villager rarity
		(that way, you can cheekily convert one to the other, at a loss,
		dependent on what is for sale)
		What is the theme for this? For now, I'll leave as 'drowning vs stake-burning'
		(tears v laughs) - but that is a bit macabre...
	
	* Some way to complicate game board - outdoorsman villager that brings up two
	'tent spots' - places to put villagers for the night where they don't interact,
	but you don't need to throw away
	- maybe they are gaurentteed to show in in caravan by X round?
